Topics to cover
===============

- Inheritance
    - not needed
        - inclusion polymorphism
        - prototype polymorphism
    - an alternative (universal quantification)

- A class is just a curried function

- Interface design
    - what is a good interface?
    - should implementation-agnostic libraries go on the trait?
