Topics to cover
===============

- Inheritance
    - not needed
        - inclusion polymorphism
        - prototype polymorphism
    - an alternative (universal quantification)

- A class is just a curried function

- Interface design
    - what is a good interface?
    - should implementation-agnostic libraries go on the trait?

- Generalize the Option data structure in Ruby or Python using the Scott encoding
    - data Maybe a = None | Some a
    - data Either a b = Left a | Right b
    - data Bool = True | False
    - data Pair a b = Pair a b
    - data Nel a = NelNil a | NelCons a (Nel a)

- Laziness and Performance in Haskell

- Consider including Rust in discussions

- Prove that functions are exponent types

- Cover Recursion and Fixed points in OO, record types
